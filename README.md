# Confluent Cloud IaC AWS Private Network Interface (PNI) with Two Isolated VPCs with Cluster Linking between them Example
This repository provides **production-grade Terraform infrastructure-as-code** that implements a **secure, multi-network Confluent Cloud architecture**. It demonstrates **AWS PrivateLink connectivity from a single Confluent Cloud environment to multiple AWS VPCs**, enabling private, network-isolated access without exposing traffic to the public internet.

The solution also showcases **in-region Cluster Linking between two Confluent Cloud Kafka clusters**, enabling **low-latency, fully managed data replication** across teams, lines of business, or isolated environments (for example, development, staging, and production) within the same AWS region.

Cluster Linking maintains an **in-sync mirror of selected topics** on the consuming cluster. This isolation allows consuming teams to independently scale **large numbers of consumers, stream processing applications, and downstream sinks** without impacting the producing cluster. From the producer’s perspective, the load is equivalent to **a single additional consumer**, regardless of downstream scale.

Access control and ownership remain cleanly separated: the producing team grants **scoped read credentials** to approved topics, while the consuming team **creates, owns, monitors, and manages the cluster link**. This pattern enables secure, scalable data sharing with clear operational boundaries and minimal coupling.

This command can be used to verify that the appropriate routes have been added to the Terraform Cloud Agent VPC route tables:
```bash
(echo -e "RouteTableId\tDestination\tGateway\tTransitGateway\tState"; \
aws ec2 describe-route-tables \
  --filters "Name=vpc-id,Values=<TFC_AGENT_VPC_ID>" \
  --output json | jq -r '.RouteTables[] | . as $rt | .Routes[] | 
  [$rt.RouteTableId, .DestinationCidrBlock, .GatewayId, .TransitGatewayId, .State] | @tsv') | \
  column -t -s $'\t'
```
